<p>After this lesson you will:</p>
<ul>
<li class="raw">understand the advantages of ZSH and Oh-my-zsh over bash,</li>
<li class="raw">be able to use some of the most used shortcuts,</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="raw">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this lesson, we will see some of the most useful features that ZSH and Oh-my-zsh have to offer and how to manage tabs and panes.</p>
<h2 class="raw">ZSH Advantages (over bash)</h2>
<p>ZSH offers more features than bash, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li class="raw">autocompletion,</li>
<li class="raw">spelling correction,</li>
<li class="raw">right prompt,</li>
<li class="raw">aliases,</li>
<li class="raw">syntax highlighting,</li>
<li class="raw">path expansion,</li>
<li class="raw">clever history,</li>
<li class="raw">easy customization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here you can find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell#Features">the full list</a> of ZSH features.</p>

<p><img class="emoji" alt=":bulb:" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hackmd/emojify.js@2.1.0/dist/images/basic/bulb.png" /> If you are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newbie">newbie</a> with the terminal, you won&rsquo;t be able to understand these benefits just yet. As you progress through the course and gain experience, these benefits will become more apparent.</p>

<h3 class="raw">Most important features</h3>
<h3 class="raw">Autocompletion</h3>
<p>Typically, bash allows you autocompletion with the <code>Tab</code> key, but it is case sensitive.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>What does it mean that bash is case sensitive and ZSH is not? Case sensitive means that uppercase and lowercase letters are different letters.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<pre><code class="shell hljs raw">$ cd de &lt;tab&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>will not autocomplete to the &ldquo;Desktop&rdquo; (folder) because Desktop begins with a capital D.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Therefore, since ZSH allows autocompletion without worrying about case sensitivity, you really don&rsquo;t have to know the exact name of the folders and files.</strong></p>
<h3 class="raw">Spelling correction</h3>
<p>ZSH shows a message if the command is misspelled when trying to execute a command and it fails:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_935cf2299ca8bdf66a9c9631a0a2ed91.png" alt="" class="raw md-image" /></p>
<h3 class="raw">Path expansion</h3>
<p>When you want to navigate deep into a particular folder, it can be tedious to do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="shell hljs raw"># Current Location: ~/

$ cd Desktop
# Current Location: ~/Desktop/

$ cd Ironhack
# Current Location: ~/Desktop/Ironhack/

$ cd labs
</code></pre>
<p>Bash allows you to do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="shell hljs raw"># Current Location: ~/
$ cd Desktop/Ironhack/labs
</code></pre>
<p>However, you will have to write the full name in every directory or file. The ZSH way:</p>
<pre><code class="shell hljs raw"># Current Location: ~/
$ cd des/iron/lab
</code></pre>
<p>Then you hit the <code>Tab</code> key, and &hellip; it will automatically transform the path!</p>
<pre><code class="shell hljs raw"># Current Location: ~/
$ cd Desktop/Ironhack/labs
</code></pre>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>Keep in mind, if you would like to try the above-mentioned commands, you have to have the folders with the same names and structure.</p>
<pre><code class="shell hljs raw">Desktop
  └── Ironhack
         └── labs
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Awesome!</strong></p>
<h2 class="raw">Creating tabs &amp; splitting panes</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236">Keyboard logo shortcuts</a></strong></p>
<p><code>⌘</code> | Command <code>⇧</code> | Shift <code>⌥</code> | Option <code>⌃</code> | Control</p>
<h3 class="raw">Managing Tabs</h3>
<p>Tabs in the terminal are just about as useful as tabs in your web browser. Before you reach to open a new terminal window, open a tab.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Operation</th><th>Mac</th><th>Linux</th><th>Windows</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Create a new Tab</td>
<td><code>⌘ + T</code></td>
<td><code>⌃ + T</code></td>
<td><code>Ctrl ⇧ T</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Close Current Tab</td>
<td><code>⌘ + W</code></td>
<td><code>⌃ + ⇧ + W</code></td>
<td><code>Ctrl ⇧ W</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 class="raw">Managing Panes</h3>
<p>Terminals allow you to divide a tab into many rectangular panes, each of which is a different terminal session (<em>don&rsquo;t worry now about what session is</em>). The advantage of doing this is that you can see them all at the same time.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Operation</th><th>Mac</th><th>Linux</th><th>Windows</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Split Pane Vertically</td>
<td><code>⌘ + ⇧ + D</code></td>
<td><code>⌃ + ⇧ + E</code></td>
<td><code>Alt ⇧ +</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Split Pane Horizontally</td>
<td><code>⌘ + D</code></td>
<td><code>⌃ + ⇧ + O</code></td>
<td><code>Alt ⇧ -</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Navigate Among Panes</td>
<td><code>⌘ + ⌥ + arrow</code></td>
<td><code>Alt + arrow</code></td>
<td><code>Alt + arrow</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Maximize One Pane</td>
<td><code>⌘ + ⇧ + Enter</code></td>
<td><code>⌃ + ⇧ + X</code></td>
<td><code>⊞ &uarr;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Close Current Pane</td>
<td><code>⌘ + W</code></td>
<td><code>⌃ + ⇧ + W</code></td>
<td><code>Ctrl ⇧ W</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 class="raw">Exercise - Practicing with panes</h2>
<p>You can always go to the menu and select options instead of using shortcuts (like the ones explained above). However, you&rsquo;ll be quicker if you learn how to do it by using shortcuts.</p>
<ol>
<li class="raw">Divide the existing sessions vertically.</li>
<li class="raw">Make sure you have two panes with different terminal sessions.
<ul>
<li class="raw">Enter the command <code>top</code> in one of the sessions to display the current working processes.</li>
<li class="raw">Type <code>ls</code> in the bottom pane.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="raw">Split the session where you typed <code>ls</code> horizontally.
<ul>
<li class="raw">Type <code>whoami</code> in the bottom-right pane.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="raw">Navigate among the different split panes.</li>
<li class="raw">Display the top pane and hide the other momentarily.</li>
<li class="raw">Restore the hidden panes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result should look something similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WOhqKMb.png" alt="" class="raw md-image" /></p>
<h2 class="raw">Passwords in the terminal</h2>
<p>Sometimes you will be asked to enter a password in the terminal, and you should be aware of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li class="raw">
<p>You will be asked to fill the password in when:</p>
<ul>
<li class="raw">
<p>You are trying to install some applications or modify something that requires <strong>admin/superuser privileges</strong>. This usually goes hand in hand with using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo"><strong>sudo</strong></a> command, which hopefully you won&rsquo;t have to use that often. However, it is good to be aware of it b sometimes we because we have to do so - when enabling a feature, modifying a system file, or for troubleshooting purposes.</p>
</li>
<li class="raw">
<p>you are setting a <strong>global user for Git</strong> (this will come up in one of the following lessons).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="raw">
<p><strong>Passwords in the terminal are invisible for security reasons.</strong></p>
<p>When you type a password in the terminal, the cursor on the screen will not move, and there is no indicator the password is being entered at all. This is intentional and serves as a security mechanism. In some other protected environments, your password will become asterisks as you type, but not in the terminal. Seeing asterisks gives observation on how long the password is, and that is already not secure and might lead to revealing passwords easier.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p><strong>To conclude</strong>: When in the terminal, just type your password and hit enter. If the password were not correct, you would be prompted to enter it again.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="raw">Summary</h2>
<p>In this lesson, you have learned which are some of the cool features of the ZSH and how to use them - autocompletion, spelling correction, easy customization, etc.</p>
<p>Also, you learned that passwords are not visible in the terminal for security reasons and that although the cursor is not moving, you should type a correct password and hit enter to execute an action you are trying to do.</p>
