# LAB | JS Clue - Mixing objects and arrays

Do you remember the classic detective board game Clue? It was a very popular game in the 90's.

The plot starts with the death of Mr. Boddy, the very wealthy owner of Tudor Manor. He was killed under _highly suspicious circumstances_, and it's the player's mission to uncover which **suspect** murdered him, what **weapon** was used, and in which **room** of the mansion the crime took place.

When playing Clue, these three details are represented by a **suspect** card, a **weapon** card and a **room** card that are kept hidden in an envelope for the duration of the game. By progressively revealing the remaining cards, the players can infer which are the three cards that are hidden. When a player is confident that they know the solution to the mystery, they will try to reveal it. If a player guesses correctly, they win the game.
