# JS | Object Oriented Intro - Part 1 - objects, methods and `this` keyword
<p></p>

<h2 class="raw">Learning Goals</h2>
<p>After this lesson you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="raw">Explain what Object Oriented Programming is</li>
<li class="raw">Comprehend the importance of thinking about objects</li>
<li class="raw">Create objects with the literal pattern</li>
<li class="raw">Access properties of an object</li>
<li class="raw">Use the <code>this</code> keyword</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="raw">Introduction</h2>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>Official definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming"><strong>object-oriented programming (OOP)</strong></a> is that it is a programming paradigm based on the concept of &ldquo;objects&rdquo;, which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as <em>attributes</em>), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as <em>methods</em>).</p>
</div>
<p>Okay, so the main take away from this is - <strong>objects</strong> are the main key/tool/means of OOP. We will try to explain this through example.</p>
<h3 class="raw">Ways of constructing the objects</h3>
<p>Some of these topics we already covered but now we will take them one step ahead.</p>
<ul>
<li class="raw">Object Literals</li>
</ul>
<p>In this lesson, we will create a very simple Monopoly game with 16 squares and 3 players. At every turn, a player launches one dice, moves forward and updates their cash based on the square&rsquo;s value.</p>
<p>You can see an example below illustrating the game we will create:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6qkhCMo.png" alt="Imgur" class="raw md-image" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>If we use <em>object literal</em> approach, which is the simplest approach we&rsquo;ve seen so far, we could simulate the game the following way:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript hljs raw">// Example of a VERY simple Monopoly game simulation

// Each square represents the cash earned when a player is on it. For example:
// - If a user is at position 0, the cash will increase by 100&euro;
// - If a user is at position 4, the cash will decrease by 40&euro;
const squares = [100, -10, 0, 0, -40, -10, -10, 5, 0, -10, -50, -10, 0, 0, -50, -10];

// --- Initialization ---
let dice;

let player1 = {
  name: 'Joaquim',
  color: 'red',
  position: 0,
  cash: 1000
};

let player2 = {
  name: 'Maxence',
  color: 'blue',
  position: 0,
  cash: 1000
};

let player3 = {
  name: 'Mostafa',
  color: 'black',
  position: 0,
  cash: 1000
};

// --- Turn of Player 1 ---
// The dice is a random integer between 1 and 6
dice = 1 + Math.floor(6 * Math.random());
// The position is always between 0 and 15 (the numbers of squares - 1)
player1.position = (player1.position + dice) % squares.length;
// The cash is updated based on the values of squares and player1.position
player1.cash += squares[player1.position];
// If the player doesn't have anymore cash, player is out of game
if (player1.cash &lt; 0) {
  console.log(`Game over for ${player1.name}.`);
}

// --- Turn of Player 2 ---
dice = 1 + Math.floor(6 * Math.random());
player2.position = (player2.position + dice) % squares.length;
player2.cash += squares[player2.position];
if (player2.cash &lt; 0) {
  console.log(`Game over for ${player2.name}.`);
}

// --- Turn of Player 3 ---
dice = 1 + Math.floor(6 * Math.random());
player3.position = (player3.position + dice) % squares.length;
player3.cash += squares[player3.position];
if (player3.cash &lt; 0) {
  console.log(`Game over for ${player3.name}.`);
}

// --- Display info  ---
console.log(player1);
console.log(player2);
console.log(player3);
</code></pre>
<p>Using this simple approach has some <strong>pros</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="raw">it&rsquo;s super convenient, straight-forward</li>
<li class="raw">very flexible in a declaration</li>
<li class="raw">very little code when declaring them</li>
<li class="raw">you can create them at any point in your code and use them without a lot of previous set up</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this approach has some <strong>cons</strong> as well:</p>
<ul>
<li class="raw">
<p><strong>We don&rsquo;t have a fast way to create the object</strong>. Instead, we always have to specify all the properties, which means a lot of copy pasting and making minor changes from object to object. (In our previous example, we are initializing the <code>position</code> to <code>0</code> and the <code>cash</code> to <code>1000</code>.)</p>
</li>
<li class="raw">
<p><strong>We don&rsquo;t have any methods for our objects</strong>. It would be nice to have a method <code>player.move()</code> instead of writing the same code again and again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="raw">Object methods and <code>this</code> keyword</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s change our code to add 2 methods: <code>move()</code> and <code>displayInfo()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="javascript hljs raw">// Example of a VERY simple Monopoly game simulation

let squares = [100, -10, 0, 0, -40, -10, -10, 5, 0, -10, -50, -10, 0, 0, -50, -10];

// --- Initialization with methods ---

let player1 = {
  name: 'Joaquim',
  color: 'red',
  position: 0,
  cash: 1000,
  move() {
    let dice = 1 + Math.floor(6 * Math.random());
    this.position = (this.position + dice) % squares.length;
    this.cash += squares[this.position];
    if (this.cash &lt; 0) {
      console.log(`Game over for ${this.name}.`);
    }
  },
  displayInfo {
    console.log(`${this.name} is at position ${this.position} and has ${this.cash}&euro;`);
  },
};

let player2 = {
  name: 'Maxence',
  color: 'blue',
  position: 0,
  cash: 1000,
  move() {
    let dice = 1 + Math.floor(6 * Math.random());
    this.position = (this.position + dice) % squares.length;
    this.cash += squares[this.position];
    if (this.cash &lt; 0) {
      console.log(`Game over for ${this.name}.`);
    }
  },
  displayInfo () {
    console.log(`${this.name} is at position ${this.position} and has ${this.cash}&euro;`);
  },
};

let player3 = {
  name: 'Mostafa',
  color: 'black',
  position: 0,
  cash: 1000,
  move() {
    let dice = 1 + Math.floor(6 * Math.random());
    this.position = (this.position + dice) % squares.length;
    this.cash += squares[this.position];
    if (this.cash &lt; 0) {
      console.log(`Game over for ${this.name}.`);
    }
  },
  displayInfo () {
    console.log(`${this.name} is at position ${this.position} and has ${this.cash}&euro;`);
  },
};

// --- Turn 1  ---
player1.move();
player2.move();
player3.move();

// --- Turn 2  ---
player1.move();
player2.move();
player3.move();

// --- Display info  ---
player1.displayInfo();
player2.displayInfo();
player3.displayInfo();
</code></pre>
<p>Let&rsquo;s analyze the new code and compare it to the previous one.</p>
<p>As we can see, the <strong>code is more readable</strong>, especially the part for &ldquo;Turn 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;Turn 2&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Our objects <code>player1</code>, <code>player2</code> and <code>player3</code> now have 2 extra properties: <code>move</code> and <code>displayInfo</code>. Both of them are functions, called <strong>methods</strong>, and they have a new keyword: <strong><code>this</code></strong>. In this context, <strong><code>this</code></strong> refers to the current object. For <code>player1</code>, inside the <code>displayInfo</code>, <code>this.name</code> === <code>player1.name</code> === <code>Joaquim</code>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>When invoking a method on an object, <strong><code>this</code> becomes the object itself</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>The last problem with have is that we don&rsquo;t have a fast way to create the objects <code>player1</code>, <code>player2</code> and <code>player3</code>. We will solve this problem in the next lecture!</p>

<h2 class="raw">Summary</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen how to create methods (a function linked to an object) and we&rsquo;ve seen the keyword <strong><code>this</code></strong> that refers to the current object.</p>
