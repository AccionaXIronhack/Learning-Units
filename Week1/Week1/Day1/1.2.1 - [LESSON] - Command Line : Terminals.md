<ul>
<li class="raw">know what terminal emulators are,</li>
<li class="raw">know what command line is,</li>
<li class="raw">understand why it is used,</li>

<li class="raw">optionally customize your terminal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="raw">Introduction</h2>
<p>You have already successfully installed terminals for your operating system - whether you work on Mac (iTerm), Ubuntu (Terminator), or Windows. Here we will shortly explain what it is and why we will be using it.</p>
<h2 class="raw">Terminal emulators</h2>
<p>Terminal emulators (synonyms are a terminal application or only term) provide text-based access to the operating system (in contrast to the mostly graphical nature of the user experience of any Operating System, which is managed with your mouse/trackpad).</p>
<p>Terminal emulators provide a command-line interface to the operating system. It is used in conjunction with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell">Unix shell</a>, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">bash</a> or <a>ZSH</a>.</p>
<h2 class="raw">Command line</h2>
<p>The command-line is a handy tool included in your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">Operating System</a>. It provides a vast number of functionalities for interacting with your computer, giving the user lots of power.</p>
<h3 class="raw">Command Line Interface (CLI)</h3>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>The <strong>Command Line <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)">Interface</a></strong>, or CLI is a terminal program that provides an interface that allows us to type text commands to our computer.</p>
<p>More straightforward explanations would be - CLI is a tool in which you can type text commands to perform specific tasks (ex. create and navigate through files and folders, open files, etc.).</p>
</div>
<p>When using your computer, you commonly point and click on graphic elements with the mouse to perform tasks (create, move, delete folders and files, execute applications, etc.). When you do that, you are using a GUI (Graphical User Interface), and its use can be replaced by the CLI.</p>
<p>In simple English, it is the way users can communicate with their computers: it provides a place where you, as a user, can type a command (but not any command, it needs to be a command understandable for computer), and then the computer will execute these commands.</p>
<p>You might ask now - why would I type commands if I can use a mouse pointer and tell my computer what to do?</p>
<p>Well, believe it or not, soon you will see, it can be much faster to complete some tasks using CLI than with graphical applications and menus. Another benefit is allowing access to many more commands and scripts.</p>
<p>In the very beginning, we defined CLI as a terminal program, but we didn&rsquo;t specify where this program can and should be installed. Each operating system (Mac, Windows, Unix/Linux) has a particular terminal program already included in itself:</p>
<ul>
<li class="raw"><em>Windows</em> includes the program <em>&ldquo;cmd.exe&rdquo;</em>, which is a CLI that can be used to run DOS commands.</li>
<li class="raw"><em>Mac OS X</em> includes a program called <em>&ldquo;Terminal&rdquo;</em>, which is used to run commands within the Mac OS.</li>
<li class="raw"><em>Unix</em> typically includes a program called <em>&ldquo;xterm&rdquo;</em>, which can run BASH or other Unix shells.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="emoji" alt=":shell:" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hackmd/emojify.js@2.1.0/dist/images/basic/shell.png" /> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)">Shell</a> is a program that processes commands and returns the output.</p>
<p><img class="emoji" alt=":bulb:" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hackmd/emojify.js@2.1.0/dist/images/basic/bulb.png" /> A terminal emulator/terminal is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell. Terminal provides a Command Line Interface to the operating system.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="raw">Opening a terminal</h2>
<p>To get started with the command line, you&rsquo;ll need to open the terminal window.</p>
<p><img class="emoji" alt=":+1:" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hackmd/emojify.js@2.1.0/dist/images/basic/+1.png" /> When you run your terminal application, your command prompt will start up pointing to a specific folder. From there, you can navigate between folders, act on files inside these folders, or perform other actions.</p>
<ul>
<li class="raw"><strong>iTerm2</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To open a terminal session in Mac OS, click on the Spotlight Search and type <code>iTerm2</code>. A new iTerm2 Terminal window will appear.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><img class="emoji" alt=":bulb:" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hackmd/emojify.js@2.1.0/dist/images/basic/bulb.png" /> Fix the launcher in the Dock navigation bar:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_0158f0a1ac247b951ce51e9988ceea4a.png" alt="" class="raw md-image" /></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="raw"><strong>Terminator</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To open a terminal session in Linux, open the Search bar and type Terminator:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_ac117c59a89dbdd144c362028bbde6c3.jpg" alt="" class="raw md-image" /></p>
<p>A new Terminator window will appear. It is recommended to fix the icon in the menu bar to have quick access to your terminal.</p>
<h3 class="raw">Our first commands (applies to all OS)</h3>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p><img class="emoji" alt=":warning:" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hackmd/emojify.js@2.1.0/dist/images/basic/warning.png" /> You do not need to type the <strong><code>$</code></strong> character when entering these commands. The terminal will automatically populate this character to let you know where your cursor is in the terminal.</p>
</div>
<pre><code>$ whoami
// This command will return your login name
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ pwd
// This command will return the path to the current folder you are working on
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ ls
// This command will list all the files and folders in the current directory
</code></pre>
<p>This was a good start! <img class="emoji" alt=":muscle:" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hackmd/emojify.js@2.1.0/dist/images/basic/muscle.png" /></p>
<h2 class="raw">Optional - Customize Your Terminal</h2>
<p>We are going to spend <em>a lot</em> of time in the terminal as developers. For some users, it feels nice to customize it with their colors and themes (similar to the desktop background).</p>
<h3 class="raw">iTerm2</h3>
<ul>
<li class="raw">Colors - option 1: <a href="https://medium.com/@Clovis_app/configuration-of-a-beautiful-efficient-terminal-and-prompt-on-osx-in-7-minutes-827c29391961">Configure terminal and prompt on MAC OS in 7 minutes</a></li>
<li class="raw">Colors - option 2: <a href="https://iterm2colorschemes.com/">iTerm2-color-schemes</a></li>
<li class="raw">Themes: <a href="https://zshthem.es/all/">Complete list of zsh themes</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="raw">Terminator</h3>
<ul>
<li class="raw"><a href="https://gist.github.com/renshuki/3cf3de6e7f00fa7e744a">How to install agnoster + Solarize color</a> in Ubuntu.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p><img class="emoji" alt=":exclamation:" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hackmd/emojify.js@2.1.0/dist/images/basic/exclamation.png" /> You can skip the <code>zsh</code> and <code>oh-my-zsh</code> installation section.</p>
